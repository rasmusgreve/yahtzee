We have used our analysis of the optimal multiplayer AI to create a restricted form of it. The reduction is to play the game with the upper categories already set. Thus the number of states becomes $14+9+1 = 24\mbox{bits}$, taking $2^{24-19} = 2^5 = 32$ times as long as the single player AI\footnote{In practice it took much less time than expected because of a high number of unreachable states}. The motivation for creating this AI is to test it respectively against single player AI and multiplayer AI.
