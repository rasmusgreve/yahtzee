The way we conduct our tests is through monte carlo testing. We therefore have to take into consideration that the results are subject to variance and we therefore have to show that our results does prove that our multiplayer strategy beats the solitaire with a high amount of significance. We can calculate significance as: %TODO add formula about signficance%
As the formula shows the significance is highly reliant on the number of games played and the difference in win rate between the two strategies. After completing $100.000$ we got the following result: %TODO add small table showing win rate of both AI's and final significance%


We have used our analysis of the optimal multiplayer AI to create a restricted form of it. The reduction is to play the game with the upper categories already set. Thus the number of states becomes $14+9+1 = 24\mbox{bits}$, taking $2^{24-19} = 2^5 = 32$ times as long as the single player AI\footnote{In practice it took much less time than expected because of a high number of unreachable states}. The motivation for creating this AI is to test it respectively against single player AI and multiplayer AI. %TODO beskriv resultaterne af multiplayer og singleplayer AI mod optimal multiplayer AI%
