Within the field of game theory there exists games with state spaces so small, that the optimal strategy can be computed within seconds. In the other end we have games with state spaces so large that calculating the optimal strategy by exploring the state space is impossible to do within a reasonable amount of time. Our focus lies on the game \emph{Yahtzee} that has a state space with a size in between - that is, a state space which could be explored in an amount of time not converging towards the impossible, but still large enough to potentially take years to finish analysing for a single computer. Our main goal is not to calculate the optimal solution but instead to improve on the current state of the art sub-optimal AI. The currently strongest strategy for implementing a \emph{Yahtzee} ai is called Single player AI. The strategy is to consider \emph{Yahtzee} a singleplayer game where the goal is to maximize your score. The state space for calculating this strategy is small enough that any modern computer will be able to perform the computations within a reasonable amount of time. We have described and implemented the single player AI algorithm using the work of James Glenn\cite{glenn2006optimal}, which gives a in depth explanation of the implementation, theory, and testing of the single player AI algorithm.

Our main goal of the project is therefore to prove that it is possible with current technology to implement a \emph{Yahtzee} AI with a better performance than the single player AI. This is widely believed to be true since there have already been made claims that this have been achieved jet how haven't been properly documented. The work by Jakub Pawlewicz is, to our knowledge, the claim of how to make a  better yahtzee AI with the strongest documentation to back it up. While the paper of Jakub Pawlewicz presents impressive results it doesn't actually test the single player AI versus a multiplayer AI. We therefore seek to prove that their exists a better sub-optimal strategy for \emph{Yahtzee} by proving that our implementation defeats the single player \emph{Yahtzee} AI more than $50"\%" $ of the time by a significant amount. The AI described in this article will only be viable for two player \emph{Yahtzee}.

We have implemented a \emph{Yahtzee} AI following a strategy somewhat similar to the single player AI except that it switch between aggression based strategies depending on it's chance to beat the other players expected final score for a given state. We will represent the theory behind the single player ai, how we have extended it into our competing multiplayer AI and show test results of how the two implementations performs when playing each other. Finally we will test each AI against a restricted optimal \emph{Yahtzee} AI and calculate the average amount of mistake made by each of them.
