Within the field of game theory there are games with small enough state space that the optimal strategy can be computed within seconds. The more likely case is games that have so large state space that calculating the optimal strategy is impossible to do within a reasonable amount of time[REF]. Our focus lies on the game yahtzee which have a state space in between, that is a state space which could be calculated in an amount of time not converging towards the impossible, but still large enough to take potentially years to finish analysing for a single computer. Our main goal is not to calculate the optimal solution but instead to improve on the current state of the art sub-optimal AI. The current popular strategy for implementing a strong ai in yahtzee is called Single player AI. The approach is to consider yahtzee a singleplayer game where the goal is to maximize your score. The state space for calculating this strategy is small enough that any modern computer will be able to perform the computations within a reasonable amount of time. We have described and implemented the single player AI algorithm using the work of James Glenn[REF], which gives a in depth explanation of the theory, implementation and testing of the single player AI algorithm. \newline \hspace*{20px} Our main goal of the project has therefore been to prove that it is possible with current technology to implement a yahtzee AI with a better performance than the single player AI. This is widely believed to be true since there have already been made claims that this have been achieved jet how haven't been properly documented. The work by Jakub Pawlewicz is, to our knowledge, the claim of having made a better yahtzee AI with the strongest documentation to back it up. While the paper of Jakub Pawlewicz presents impressive results it doesn't actually test the single player AI versus a multiplayer AI. We therefore seek to prove definitely that their exists a better sub-optimal strategy for yahtzee by proving that our implementation defeats the single player yahtzee AI more than $50"\%" $ of the time by a significant amount.
