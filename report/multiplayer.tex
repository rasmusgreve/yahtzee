Before starting to implement our multiplayer AI we need to justify it's creation. We therefore need to answer why not just calculate the optimal strategy for two player yahtzee by analysing the whole state space, since yahtzee is borderline calculable by modern computers. We can analyse the state space for the optimal two player strategy the same way we did with single player yahtzee. First we have 13 bit for each player to keep track of their scoreboards, 6 bit per player for keeping track of their upper section score, 10 bits for keeping track of the difference between the two players score and 1 bit for keeping track of what players turn it is. Therefore the amount of different states is at most $26+12+10+1 = 49\mbox{bits}$ if we don't consider the existence of unreachable states. This would therefore take naively $2^{49-19} = 2^{30}$ times longer to calculate than the single player AI. Also even in the case of the states only requiring 1 byte of memory the whole cache would still fill $562 \mbox{TB}$ which have to be within memory when running the AI. 

In conclusion even an optimized algorithm would require an enormous setup for calculating the optimal two player strategy. We strive to make an AI which can be run and computed on most modern computers and perform better than single player AI by considering information about it's opponent. The implementation uses the same dynamic programming as single player AI, that is it calculates a cache containing the values of the different states. The difference is that we calculate many caches for different degrees of aggression levels, referred to as strategies. The strategy is then changed depending on the difference between the AI and the opponent expected score\footnote{Expected score is found by running single player AI for the opponents current state}. The strategy is chosen by finding the probability of beating the other players expected score. The probability can be found using the cummulative normal distribution
