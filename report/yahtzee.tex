\emph{Yahtzee} is a stochastic game where one or more players can participate. 
When playing alone (solitaire \emph{Yahtzee}) the goal of the game is to get as high a score as possible. 
When playing against others, the goal instead is to get more point \emph{than any other player}.

Each player takes turn rolling five 6-sided dice, and for each turn has two chances to re-roll any number of the dice. At the end of the turn the player has to select one out of the 13 categories of his \emph{Yahtzee}-scoreboard, and a score is given according to the scoring rules of each category.\footnote{A complete table with all the scoring rules can be found in appendix}%TODO: Ref appendix %

The game always have 13 rounds, and ends when every player has filled every category on their respective scoreboard.
