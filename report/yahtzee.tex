Yahtzhee is a game of chance where one or more players can participate. Each player takes turn rolling $1-5$ dices. A turn consists of three rolls. Before the second and third roll the player choose which dices to keep and which to reroll. After having rolled three times or decided to keep a particular combination the player has to select 1 out 13 categories where he will be assigned a score according to the individual rule of each category(See Table \ref{tab:rollout_cap_results} for clarification of each category). The game ends when every category has been set for each player and the player with the highest score wins.
