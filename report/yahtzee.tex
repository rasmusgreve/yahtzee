\emph{Yahtzee} is a stochastic game where one or more players can participate. Each player takes turn rolling $1-5$ dice. A turn consists of three rolls. Before the second and third roll the player choose which dices to keep and which to re-roll. After having rolled three times or decided to keep a particular combination the player has to select 1 out 13 categories where he will be assigned a score according to the individual rule of each category. The game ends when every category has been set for each player and the player with the highest score wins.
